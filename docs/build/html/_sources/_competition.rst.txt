 Real-world optimization problems often consist of several NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems that interact with each other.
  Such multi-component optimization problems are difficult to solve not only because of the contained hard optimization problems, but in particular,
  because of the interdependencies between the different components.
  Interdependence complicates a decision making by forcing each sub-problem to influence the quality and feasibility of solutions of the other sub-problems.
  This influence might be even stronger when one sub-problem changes the data used by another one through a solution construction process.
  Examples of multi-component problems are vehicle routing problems under loading constraints, the maximizing material utilization while respecting a production schedule,
  and the relocation of containers in a port while minimizing idle times of ships.<br><br>

  The goal of this competition is to provide a platform for researchers in
  computational intelligence working on multi-component optimization problems.
  The main focus of this competition is on the combination of TSP and Knapsack problems.
  However, we plan to extend this competition format to more complex combinations of problems (that have typically been dealt with individually in the past decades) in the upcoming years.


  The set of benchmarks used in this competition follows the idea of the "Travelling Thief Problem" (Mohammad Reza Bonyadi, Zbigniew Michalewicz, Luigi Barone:
  <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6557681&amp;tag=1" target="_blank">The travelling thief problem: The first step in the transition from theoretical problems to realistic problems.</a>
  IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2013: 1037-1044).
  Euclidian 2D Traveling Salesperson instances are combined with 0-1-Knapsack instances in such a way that it reflects aspects of problems from the real-world;
  for example, the total weight of the items in the knapsack influences the travel speed of a traveller.
  This introduced interdependence sets our benchmarks apart from capacitated vehicle routing problem instances, where this interdependence does not exist.

  <!--A range of sample instances is available for researchers to experiment with before the final submission.
  The samples will include instances with few/many cities, with uncorrelated/correlated profits and weights, and instances with further characteristics.<br><br>-->
